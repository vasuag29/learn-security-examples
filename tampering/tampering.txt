- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability exists in the text input field which accepts the name of the user. In the 'insecure.js' server,
the text input is not parsed or verified anywhere so this is how a mailicious user can input some script code in 
the input field and that script will be executed on the server. This can lead to several data breaches and other
vulnerabilities.
The 'secure.js' server uses a function to sanitize the input text before using it. The function repalces all 
special characters with their literal plain text equivalents, hence preventing any script code from entering
the server.

- Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Tampering primarily violates the CIA property of integrity in information security, 
which ensures that data remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. When data or 
systems are tampered with, unauthorized alterations can occur, leading to misleading information,
disrupted operations, or financial losses. This compromises the trustworthiness of systems and data, 
eroding confidence in their accuracy and reliability. Consequently, tampering poses a significant 
threat to the integrity of information, necessitating robust security measures to protect against 
unauthorized modifications and ensure the reliability of data and systems.
