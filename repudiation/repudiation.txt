- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
The insecure.js server does not provide any mechanism for keeping track of server activity and actions being performed on the server.
So if a user message is found on the server, there is no way to validate if the message was entered by the mentioned user or some other user.
Essentially, there is no way of accurately verifying the claim that a certain was posted by the user whose name appears with the message.
The secure.js server provides a logging mechanism for logging every server activity in detail, creating an audit trail. These logs can help us
in identifying and verifying server and user activity, preventing repudiation.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Immutable Logs: We can ensure that logs generated by the server are immutable and tamper-evident. 
By using techniques such as cryptographic hashing or digital signatures, you can make sure that logs cannot be 
altered after they've been created, providing a reliable record of server activity.

User Authentication and Authorization: We can implement robust user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users 
can perform actions on the server. This includes techniques such as multi-factor authentication and session management to 
prevent unauthorized access.
