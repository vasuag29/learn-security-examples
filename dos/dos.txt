- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure.js server exposes an API which allows fetching user data for a given '_id' query parameter.
The mongo query for matching the '_id' for a document requires only an ObjectId string to be passed as an argument.
A malicious user here, can passed arbitrary string or values to the mongo query using the API, causing the mongo query function to throw an unhandled
exception and crash the server. The malicious user can keep doing this multiple times and crash all server instances.
The secure.js server, however, uses a try-catch block to handle this exception gracefully, allowing to server to stay up even if invalid inputs
are received.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Input Validation: We can implement robust input validation to ensure that only valid inputs are accepted by the API. 
For example, you can validate that the '_id' parameter is a valid ObjectId string before passing it to the MongoDB query.

Rate Limiting: We could implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests that can be made to the API within a certain time period. 
This can help mitigate the impact of a malicious user attempting to repeatedly crash the server by sending invalid inputs.
