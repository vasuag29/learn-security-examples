- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure.js server does not preprocess the API query input and passes it directly to the mongo query.
This can lead to possible NoSQL injection as observed by passing a value of '[$ne]=' to the API. This leads to the execution of this mongo query,
and the information is fetched from the database even though the expected conditions for finding a document are not met.
The secure.js server, however, sanitizes the input query string and removes non-alphanumeric characters from it before passing it to the mongo query.
This makes sure that NoSQL injection is not possible on the server.


- Which CIA property does Information Disclosure violate?
Confidentiality: Information disclosure violates confidentiality when unauthorized individuals or systems gain access to sensitive or 
confidential information. This can lead to the exposure of private data, trade secrets, or classified information.

Integrity: Information disclosure can also compromise integrity by allowing unauthorized parties to modify or manipulate data. 
This could involve altering records, tampering with transactions, or introducing false information into a system.


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
We can add user authentication on the server, which would allow only authenticated users from calling the server APIs and hence
restrict access to data and its manipulation.
